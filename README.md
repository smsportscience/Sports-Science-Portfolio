Welcome to my Sports Science Portfolio!

I am Sam Molloy, currently a sports science graduate from University College Dublin and an aspiring video and data analyst in soccer and GAA!

This portfolio is a collection of video analysis and data analysis projects that I have worked on in my sports science career to date. Below is a short description of each element of this portfolio.

I am open and welcome to constructive feedback as I am willing to learn and grow in this field! If you'd like to connect or have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to reach out at any of my contacts below.

Dashboards: This is a VALD monitoring dashboard for Track and Field athletes at Duke University. This dashboard includes a quick snapshot of the team countermovement jump (CMJ) metrics of interest as well as individual longitudinal monitoring. I also calculated a Dynamic Strngth Index (DSI) score, a ratio that measures the athletes' elastic CMJ properties compared to their force production during an isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP).

Eire Og Under-19 Hurling Season Analysis Project: The OpenBiomechanics Project is open source data provided by Driveline Baseball. I utilized the baseball_pitching point-of-interest csv provided by Driveline to conduct descriptive and exploratory analysis for my personal development of coding and statistical analysis.
